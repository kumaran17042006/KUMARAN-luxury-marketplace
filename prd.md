# Product Requirements Document (PRD)

## 1. App Overview & Objectives

### Product Name (Working Title)

High-Performance Automotive Brand Website (Demo Project)

### Overview

This project is a **learning-focused demo website** for a fictional high-performance luxury automotive brand. The experience is designed to emotionally engage users through **iconic heritage storytelling delivered via modern, cinematic web interactions**.

### Primary Objectives

* Convey speed, legacy, and exclusivity through motion and visual hierarchy

* Serve as a learning exercise in emotional design and premium UX thinking

### Non-Objectives (Explicitly Out of Scope)

* Real bookings, payments, or form submissions
* User accounts or personalization
